### About Me
My name is Cameron Haley, and I am a second-year undergraduate studying Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Tullahoma, Tennessee, a small town south of Nashville. I am one of four children in my family- I have a twin brother, and my older brother and sister are also twins!

My first foray into web design was through a library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org "p5.js Official Website"), a JavaScript library that I used to visualize a random idea I had at the time (that I have since forgotten). Through this, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then, I\'ve kept mostly to the JavaScript side (through Node.js), but I have created fairly basic websites simply out of necessity- an example being my most recent, [a schedule generator for IIT students](https://camero2734.github.io/iitschedulegen/).

### Goals for this class
Although I have tinkered around with web development in the past, there is still so much more for me to learn. Thus far in the class, I have already learned many things I didn\'t know before; my goal for this class is to take as much away as I can in the area of design principles, such as typography, mobile-first design, and good practices in the realm of CSS.

### The Future
As I continue my college career after this class, I know I will still be designing web pages, whether for personal projects, school projects, or professional ones. My future goal as it relates to this class is to continue using *standards-based* web design in my projects, rather than sloppy, meandering code that merely "gets the job done".
