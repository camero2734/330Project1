### About Me
I am a second-year undergraduate studying Computer Engineering. My first foray into web design was through a library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org "p5.js Official Website"), a JavaScript library that I used to visualize a random idea I had at the time (that I have since forgotten). Through this, I learned the basics of JavaScript, as well as a bit of HTML and CSS. However, I decided to transition to Node.js and since then I have only ventured back to web design only when necessary.

### Goals for this class
Although I have tinkered around with web development in the past, there is still so much more for me to learn. Thus far in the class, I have already learned many things I didn\'t know before; I look forward to learning more, especially on the design principles of web pages.
