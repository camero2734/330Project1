        <h2>•About Me•</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cameron Haley, and I am a second-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Tullahoma, Tennessee, a small town south of Nashville.

            I am one of four children in my family- I have a twin brother, and my older brother and sister are also twins!
        </p>
        <!-- TODO: Add picture of family probably -->

        <p>
            My first foray into web design was through a library called <a href="https://p5js.org" title="p5.js Official Website">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library that I used to visualize a random idea I had at the time (that I have since forgotten).
            <br><br>
            Since then, I have used p5 to aid in visualization of numerous projects, such as testing pathfinding algorithms.

        <p>
            Through this, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then, I've kept mostly to the JavaScript side (through Node.js), but I have created fairly basic websites simply out of necessity- an example being my most recent, <a href="https://camero2734.github.io/iitschedulegen/" title="IIT Schedule Generator webpage">a schedule generator for IIT students</a>.

        <h2>•Class Goals + The Future•</h2>
        <p>
            Although I have tinkered around with web development in the past, there is still so much more for me to learn. Thus far in the class, I have already learned many things I didn't know before; my goal for this class is to take as much away as I can in the area of design principles, such as typography, mobile-first design, and good practices in the realm of CSS.
            <br><br>
            As I continue my college career after this class, I know I will still be designing web pages, whether for personal projects, school projects, or professional ones. My future goal as it relates to this class is to continue using <em>standards-based</em> web design in my projects, rather than sloppy, meandering code that merely "gets the job done".
