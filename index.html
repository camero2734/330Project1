        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cameron Haley, and I am a second-year undergraduate studying Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Tullahoma, Tennessee, a small town south of Nashville. I am one of four children in my family- I have a twin brother, and my older brother and sister are also twins!
