    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Cameron Haley, and I am a second-year undergraduate
      student studying Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of
      Technology. I was born and raised in Tullahoma, Tennessee, a small
      town south of Nashville.

    <p>
      I am one of four children in my family- I have a twin brother, and
      my older brother and sister are also twins!
    </p>

    <p>
      My first foray into web design was through a library called
      <a href="https://p5js.org" title="p5.js Official Website">p5.js</a>,
      a JavaScript library that I used to visualize a random idea I had at
      the time (that I have since forgotten).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have used p5 to aid in visualization of numerous
      projects, such as testing pathfinding algorithms.

      Through this, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then, I've
      kept mostly to the JavaScript side (through Node.js), but I have
      created fairly basic websites simply out of necessity- an example
      being my most recent, <a href="https://camero2734.github.io/iitschedulegen/"
      title="IIT Schedule Generator webpage">a schedule generator for IIT
      students</a>.

    <h2>Class Goals + The Future</h2>
    <p>
      Although I have tinkered around with web development in the past,
      there is still so much more for me to learn. Thus far in the class,
      I have already learned many things I didn't know before; my goal for
      this class is to take as much away as I can in the area of design
      principles, such as typography, mobile-first design, and good
      practices in the realm of CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue my college career after this class, I know I will
      still be designing web pages, whether for personal projects, school
      projects, or professional ones. My future goal as it relates to this
      class is to continue using <em>standards-based</em> web design in my
      projects, rather than sloppy, meandering code that merely "gets the
      job done".
